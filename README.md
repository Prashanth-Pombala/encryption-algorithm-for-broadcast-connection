# Encryption_algorithm_for_Broadcast_Connection using Cryptography

This is my Bachelor Thesis carried out in Anna University 2018.<br>

The objective of the project is to establish a new cryptographic algorithm to enable secure transmission of information in a broadcast connection and to facilitate secret sharing of information
with a user in broadcast connection without the knowledge of the other users who are part of the broadcast network connection. <br>

The method provides a means of communication with multiple users using electromagnetic waves of same frequency and by transmitting a single block of message. <br>

A single user can simultaneously communicate with multiple users by sending a single common message in the broadcast channel, at the receiver end the common message
transforms into the specific message that needs to be conveyed to each individual user.

## Implementation
UserA - Sender <br>
UserB - Receiver 1 <br>
UserC - Receiver 2 <br>
